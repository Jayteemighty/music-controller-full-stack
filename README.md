# Music-Controller
# Django & React Full Stack Web App



Music-Controller is a web application designed to host music. It provides an intuitive interface for browsing, searching, and filtering music items, along with the ability to add new items via an API. The project utilizes a combination of React for the frontend and Django for the backend.

## Stack

- **Frontend**: Built using Next.js, a popular React framework for building modern web applications. It offers server-rendered React applications and features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing.

- **Backend**: Developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It includes powerful features such as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system and built-in administrative interface.
